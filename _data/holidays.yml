  description: "St. Patrick’s Day is an annual celebration intended to commemorate the life of Saint Patrick, who was a huge figure in bringing Christianity to Ireland. Today, we know the 17th as a day filled with food and drinks, shamrocks, and a whole lot of green. This year, it’s likely that people will be celebrating the holiday differently."
